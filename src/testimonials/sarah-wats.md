We felt very lucky & grateful to find Sandra as my home birth doula. Despite meeting her last minute (as my previous Doula could no long attend) Sandra took on the roll perfectly. I instantly felt comfortable and safe around her. Sandra has a great understanding of birth & she provided much care and support throughout. Sandra was an amazing help after the birth with the clean up and care. She took home some of our washing & made me delicious nourishing food.
