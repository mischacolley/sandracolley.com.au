# Doula Sandra

I am a nurturing, experienced and passionate birth doula.

Over the last few years of working as a doula I have come to the understanding how important it is for me to master the art of following my intuition to put my knowledge into practice so you can get the best possible support in your birth journey.

[My clients describe me as](#testimonials) the calm in the storm, being both nurturing and grounding while staying focused on what lies ahead. I have a great sense of clarity around pregnancy and birth and am extremely reliable.

You, your family and your birth experience are unique and itâ€™s my practice to support your individual choices in a compassionate and respectful way. It is vital that you feel safe, loved and nurtured as you embark on the journey to birth your baby/s. I am committed to support you and advocate for your needs with all my capacities.

I live with my beautiful family near Byron Bay in the Northern Rivers region of NSW, Australia. Bundjalung and Yugambeh country. I service all areas in the Byron shire as well as Lennox Head, Lismore, Murwillumbah, Ballina, Tweed Heads and the Gold Coast.
