# Doula Sandra

  
Pregnancy can be a special and magical time of your life, it may also be a time when you would like to feel more supported and confident for birthing. As an experienced, passionate and certified birth doula I’d love to offer you just that.

You, your family and your birth experience are unique and it’s my practice to support your personal choices in a compassionate and respectful way. I invite you to feel safe, loved and confident as you embark on your journey to birth your baby/s.

Over the last few years working as a doula I have come to the understanding, of just how important it is to master the art of following my intuition and to put my knowledge into practice so you can get the best possible support in your birth journey.

[My clients describe me as](#testimonials) the calm in the storm, being both nurturing and grounding while staying focused on what lies ahead. I have a great sense of clarity around pregnancy and birth and am extremely reliable.

I do not discriminate over how, where and with whom you’d like to birth your baby and will advocate for you and your needs to be heard and met.

I live with my beautiful family near Byron Bay in the Northern Rivers region of NSW, Australia. Bundjalung and Yugambeh country. I service all areas in the Byron shire as well as Lennox Head, Lismore, Murwillumbah, Ballina, Tweed Heads and the Gold Coast.
