# Doula Sandra

Pregnancy can be a special and magical time of your life, it may also be a time when you would like to feel more supported and confident for birthing or your postpartum period. As an experienced, passionate and certified birth and postpartum doula I’d love to offer you just that. There is no such thing as being too supported during pregnancy, birth and early parenthood. Rather the lack of support is where the problems start.

Over the last few years working as a doula I have mastered the art of following my intuition and to put my knowledge into practice. I’m committed to supporting you in experiencing an empowered birth and postpartum journey. I invite you to tune into your baby and your intuition as much as possible. She’ll guide you on this journey.

You, your birth experience and your family are unique and it’s my practice to support your personal choices in a compassionate and respectful way. I invite you to feel safe, loved and confident as you embark on your journey to birth your baby/ies.
I offer individualised educational, physical and emotional support during your pregnancy, birth and postnatal period. This will ultimately support you in creating the birth you and your baby need for a bright future.

My clients describe me as the calm in the storm, being both nurturing and grounding while staying focused on what lies ahead. I have a great sense of clarity around pregnancy and birth and am extremely reliable.

I do not discriminate over how, where and with whom you’d like to birth your baby and will advocate for you and your needs to be heard and met.

I live with my beautiful family near Byron Bay in the Northern Rivers region of NSW, Australia. Bundjalung and Yugambeh. I service all areas in the Byron shire as well as Lennox Head, Lismore, Murwillumbah, Ballina, Tweed Heads and the Gold Coast.
