## What I offer

As a birth doula I am your personal, non medical birth assistant.

I offer individualised educational, physical and emotional support during your pregnancy, birth and postnatal period.

Some days this might be a chat and a laugh or cry and on another itâ€™s practical or physical support. Some things you may choose to be part of your individual birth support can include:

* Supporting your knowledge of how to safely birth your baby (i.e. personal birth prep. for you and your team)
* Unbiased support in making informed decisions through pregnancy, birth and early parenthood.
* Creating your unique Birth Plan with a clear picture of the choices you can make
* Emotional support (overcoming fear, anxiety and embracing joy)
* Physical support (acupressure, movement, positioning for an optimal birth)
* Passing on my professional knowledge as a birth keeper as well as unlimited access to my birth library
* Alternative/natural pain relief methods
* Support in creating the perfect birthing environment, catered to your needs
* Nurishment (wholesome home cooked meals)
* Commitment to you and your birth
* Advocacy
* I will ultimately support you in creating the birth you and your baby need for a bright future
