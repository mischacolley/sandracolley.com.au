Giving birth is a life changing experience, an event you will remember for the rest of your life. Something to consider in relation to this may be the importance of the birth of your child and how much in relation you’d pay for your wedding, holidays, a website and any other business related expenses.

Birth is an incredibly important and life changing experience and I’d love to support you regardless of your financial situation. Keeping in mind that it also needs to be sustainable for me and my family.

Living in this ever changing, evolving beautiful world of ours I’d like to suggest something that is quite new to me. Nevertheless part of what my ideal world looks like.

I’d like to invite you to have a think about what a commitment of having the support of a doula would look like and what it would mean to you in your life. What would an adequate/ fair price look like to you?

Be part of the change to support care workers in the way they need to be supported.

Please know that a generous percentace of all payments you make for your birth, go towards paying it forward to someone else, who may otherwise not be able to afford the birth support they need. For about every 5 births I support I can gift my doula support to someone in need.

If that is you and you are in need of birth support please get in touch as I’d love to see how I can support you.

As a certified birth doula I am also able to accept NDIS funding in some cases.
