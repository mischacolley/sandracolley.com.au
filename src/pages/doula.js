            <h3>Why do I need a Doula?</h3>

            <p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/23076901/?fbclid=IwAR23D9YAVziONYEudiQR2LKvfZ4ZaCCk5P_FhxDM7JpZ7qazctxw1YsiHg8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies show</a> that in 95% of births doulas lead to a shorter labour, more spontaneous vaginal birth (lower chances of induction), less cesareans and instrumental births, fewer pain medication and epidural, less babies with a low 5min. Apgar score and overall more satisfaction with the birth experience.</p>
