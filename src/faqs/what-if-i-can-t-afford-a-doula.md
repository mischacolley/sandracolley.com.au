title: What if I can’t afford a doula?

I am happy to work out a payment plan that works around your needs.

It’s also great to think about prioritising and comparing the birth of your baby/s with other expenses in your life (holidays, weddings, business expenses etc..). A doula is an excellent investment into the future of your new family.

A percentage of my fees are to cover pro bono clients such as teenagers, single parents or people living in financial difficulties. If you find yourself in a difficult situation I’ll do my best to support your birthing needs, please do feel free to contact me.
