[Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076901/) show that in 95% of births doulas lead to a shorter labour, more spontaneous vaginal birth (lower chances of induction), less cesareans and instrumental births, fewer pain medication and epidural, less babies with a low 5min. Apgar score and overall more satisfaction with the birth experience.
