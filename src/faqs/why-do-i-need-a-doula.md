[Studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076901/) show that in 95% of births doulas lead to a shorter labour, more spontaneous vaginal birth (lower chances of induction), less cesareans and instrumental births, fewer pain medication and epidural, less babies with a low 5min. Apgar score and overall more satisfaction with the birth experience.

Birth can be a pretty intense process and itâ€™s incredibly beneficial for you and your family to have a birth professional that you know and trust by your side at all times.

I believe being prepared for one of the most important journeys and having you well supported is key for an empowering birth experience and amazing start into parenthood.

And why not have your own personal birth assistant?
