title: What about my partner/ father of the baby wonâ€™t they feel left out?

It is important to remember that they also are becoming a parent and that the birth of your baby/s may also be a big day for them. The birthing person is my first priority but I am also committed to supporting your partner/s through this transition.

You and your family's needs are important and I will therefore of course make space to support your partner/s to support you. I believe birth flows best with a trusted support team.

I am able to give clarity for their questions on pregnancy, birth and the early days of parenthood or they may want to learn techniques of how to support you along the birth journey. I am mostly seen as a relief in the case of involved birth partners rather than taking any of their journey away from them.
